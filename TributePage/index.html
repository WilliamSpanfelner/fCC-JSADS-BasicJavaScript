            The Saturn V (pronounced "Saturn five") was an American human-rated expendable rocket used by NASA between
            1967
            and 1973.[7] The three-stage liquid-fueled super heavy-lift launch vehicle was developed to support the
            Apollo
            program for human exploration of the Moon and was later used to launch Skylab, the first American space
            station.<br><br>

            The Saturn V was launched 13 times from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida with no loss of crew or payload.
            As
            of 2018, the Saturn V remains the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful (highest total impulse) rocket ever
            brought to operational status, and holds records for the heaviest payload launched and largest payload
            capacity
            to low Earth orbit (LEO) of 140,000 kg (310,000 lb), which included the third stage and unburned propellant
            needed to send the Apollo Command/Service Module and Lunar Module to the Moon.[5][6]<br><br>

            The largest production model of the Saturn family of rockets, the Saturn V was designed under the direction
            of
            Wernher von Braun and Arthur Rudolph at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, with
            Boeing,
            North American Aviation, Douglas Aircraft Company, and IBM as the lead contractors.<br><br>

            To date, the Saturn V remains the only launch vehicle to carry humans beyond low Earth orbit. A total of 15
            flight-capable vehicles were built, but only 13 were flown. An additional three vehicles were built for
            ground
            testing purposes. A total of 24 astronauts were launched to the Moon, three of them twice, in the four years
            spanning December 1968 through December 1972.
